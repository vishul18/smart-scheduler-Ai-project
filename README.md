# smart-scheduler-Ai-project
# üß† Smart Scheduler AI Agent ‚Äì Google Colab Version
# Run this code on GOOGLE COLAB 

This is an interactive AI-powered chatbot built using **Gradio in Google Colab**. It helps users schedule meetings through a conversational interface. The logic is powered by simulated natural language understanding and mock calendar integration.

## üîß Technologies Used

- Python 3
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)
- Google Colab
- Simulated Gemini-like logic
- Mock Google Calendar integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This is a **demo version**: no real LLM or calendar API is used.
- Ideal for testing UI logic, prompt flow, and assistant reasoning.

---

## üì§ Optional Enhancements

You can add the following for a more realistic project:
- Real Google Calendar API integration
- Gemini Pro (via Google AI Studio) or OpenAI API
- Voice input/output (with LiveKit or Whisper)
- Persistent context per user using Google Drive or Firestore
